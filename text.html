		<p>"My Man" is a song by American singer Tamar Braxton (pictured) for her fifth studio album Bluebird of Happiness (2017). Braxton and Cory Rooney wrote the song, which was produced by Bob Robinson. It was released as the album's lead single on April 27, 2017, through Tamartian Land, an independent record label Braxton created in partnership with eOne Entertainment. An R&B and soul song, it is about infidelity and was based on Braxton's parents and their divorce after her father's affair. Critics considered it a highlight of Bluebird of Happiness and praised Braxton's vocals. It peaked at number three on Billboard's Adult R&B Songs chart and number twenty-one on their Hot R&B Songs chart. Laurieann Gibson directed the music video, portraying Braxton confronting her lover with a mistress in a hotel room. Braxton's performance of the song at the BET Awards 2017 was praised as one of the event's highlights, although some critics believed that she was lip syncing. (Full article...)</p>
